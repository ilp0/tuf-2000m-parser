## Option 1: Parsing the Modbus data

Create a program that parses the data, converts it to human readable data like integers, decimals and strings and presents it in a nice way. Depending on your skills and interests you can create a web service that will provide the conversion data, or you could even create a UI to visualize the data somehow, it is entirely up to you what you make of it!

## Option 2: Web or native app

If the data conversion path in option 1 is not something that interests you, or you prefer a more graphical solution, create an app that retrieves and parses the data and presents it as is. The key point is to make use of data available in a backend, and present it in a mobile friendly way.
